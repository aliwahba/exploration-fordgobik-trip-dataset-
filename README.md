# exploration-fordgobik-trip-dataset-

This project is divided into two major parts. In the first part, you will conduct an exploratory data analysis on a dataset Ford GoBike System Data. I will use Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. The analysis in this part should be structured, going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships
In the second part, I will take my main findings from my exploration and convey them to others through an explanatory analysis. To this end, I will create a slide deck that leverages polished, explanatory visualizations to communicate my results.
This document explores a dataset containing the trip data of the ford gobike approximately 183,412 with 16 features (duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude ,end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender, bike_share_for_all_trip). Most variables are 9 numerical, and others are 2 datetime, 4 object type and 1 is boolean type.
For clean dataser are the following:
1- change the data type for start and end time to be datetime64. 2- change the data type for bike_share_for_all_trip to be bool
